## Task 1: Exploring and Visualizing a Simple Dataset

### Task Objective
To explore, analyze, and visualize a dataset in order to understand data structure, feature relationships, and basic statistical properties.

### Dataset Used
- **Iris Dataset** (CSV)

### Models Applied
- No machine learning model applied (Exploratory Data Analysis task)

### Key Results & Findings
- Identified clear separability between flower species based on petal length and width.
- Visualizations helped reveal feature distributions and outliers.
- Gained understanding of dataset structure and feature correlations.

## Task 2: Predict Future Stock Prices (Short-Term)

### Task Objective
To predict the **next day’s stock closing price** using historical market data.

### Dataset Used
- Stock market data fetched using **yfinance python library**

### Models Applied
- Linear Regression  
- Random Forest Regressor

### Key Results & Findings
- Random Forest performed better than Linear Regression in capturing non-linear price patterns.
- Visualization of actual vs predicted prices helped evaluate model performance.
- Learned how to handle time-series data and external APIs.

## Task 3: Heart Disease Prediction

### Task Objective
To predict whether a patient is at risk of heart disease based on medical attributes.

### Dataset Used
- **Heart Disease UCI Dataset** (Kaggle)

### Models Applied
- Logistic Regression  
- Decision Tree Classifier

### Key Results & Findings
- Logistic Regression provided stable and interpretable results.
- Important features such as age, cholesterol, and blood pressure influenced predictions.
- Model evaluation was performed using accuracy, ROC curve, and confusion matrix.

## Task 4: General Health Query Chatbot

### Task Objective
To build a chatbot capable of answering **general health-related questions** safely and clearly.

### Dataset / Model Used
- **google/flan-t5-small** (pre-trained language model)

### Models Applied
- Transformer-based Language Model (FLAN-T5)

### Key Results & Findings
- Chatbot successfully answered common health queries in natural language.
- Safety filters prevented medical advice beyond general information.
- Learned prompt engineering and LLM-based application design.
